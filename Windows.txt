_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.<domain> just asks DNS which hosts advertise LDAP on Domain Controllers. It doesn’t prove a DC is up—only that its DNS records exist. To check reachability, also test the port.
nslookup -type=SRV _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.totallogistics.com

Resolve-DnsName -Type SRV _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.totallogistics.local

you have two DCs: tlc-pdc01 and tlc-dc02. Each advertises LDAP (port 389) via SRV.

Priority/Weight meaning

Priority: lower is tried first. Both are 0, so they’re equal.

Weight: load-share among records with the same priority. Both are 100, so clients distribute traffic roughly evenly.

It’s not a strict “alternate every request”; client DC-locator logic may cache and prefer one for a while.



Confirm the DC is reachable (not just in DNS):
Test-NetConnection dc01.totallogistics.com -Port 389    # LDAP
Test-NetConnection dc01.totallogistics.com -Port 3268   # Global Catalog (LDAP)


You can manually force a domain computer to resync by using the command:
w32tm /resync

Non-admin users can usually query only:

w32tm /query /status
w32tm /query /source
